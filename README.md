I built this project so I could learn how to test. I followed a course on udemy, but I built the app on my onw so I could test my skills, then I followed the testing sections. I tested it using jest and enzyme and I encountered some unique problems along the way. The biggest being how to test a timeout function and how to test cookies. Those took me a while to figure out. Here is a screen shot of the project.
